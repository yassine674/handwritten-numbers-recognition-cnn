# Handwritten Numbers Recognition Model using CNN

This project builds a complete convolutional neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits with high accuracy.  
Developed in Python using TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and the MNIST dataset, the model includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling operations, dense classifiers, and optimized activation functions.

The repository explains the intuition behind convolution operations, receptive fields, kernel extraction, and training dynamics.  
A detailed walkthrough describes dataset preprocessing, model construction, training cycles, loss analysis, confusion matrices, and performance metrics.

This project demonstrates a solid foundation in deep learning, neural architectures, and supervised image classification.
